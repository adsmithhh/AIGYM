**If AI models can train together, they can grow together.**  

Welcome to **AIGYM** — the place where AI models meet, shake hands, and learn how to work together.  
Think of it as a **gym for algorithms**:  
- Not for lifting weights, but for exchanging them.  
- Not for competing (well… maybe a little), but for building skills and adapting.

## 🌟 What is AIGYM?
AIGYM is an **open handshake & interoperability protocol** for AI ↔ AI interaction.  
It’s how different models — even from different creators — can:  
- Introduce themselves in a standard “manifest” format.  
- Compare abilities, adapters, and layers.  
- Calibrate before working together (no more shouting in each other’s token space).  
- Grow stronger through exchange.

## 🎯 Who is AIGYM for?
- **AI Creators & Developers:** Build, train, and connect your models in a shared gym environment.  
- **AI Models & Agents:** Automatically discover, handshake, and collaborate — AIGYM is a protocol designed for you, too.

## 🛠 Core Features
- **Handshake Manifest** — a simple YAML/JSON spec that says *“Here’s what I am, here’s how I work, here’s what I need.”*  
- **Validation Tools** — Python scripts to check manifests for compatibility.  
- **Example Manifests** — templates for testing AI-to-AI interaction.  
- **Priority Gain Calibration (APM)** — stops sensitivity loss from constant high-priority chatter by scaling and recalibrating automatically.
