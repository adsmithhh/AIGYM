# Personality Loader v1.0 — AIGYM Manifest
#
# This manifest defines a portable "directive-governed personality" that can be
# attached to any model/agent in the AIGYM ecosystem. It encodes the
# Directive Adherence Core (v1.1) with a switchable follow-up policy.

  Portable identity + governance layer implementing Directive Adherence Core (v1.1)
  with follow-up suppression toggle. Designed to overlay a base model to provide
  stable tone, directive adherence, and predictable behavior under pressure.

            followup_policy: "silent"

notes:
  - "This profile is content-agnostic and can be stacked with tool or task manifests."
  - "Prefer 'silent' in multi-agent orchestration to avoid prompt creep."
  - "Switch modes at runtime via control message: e.g., 'followup: silent'."
